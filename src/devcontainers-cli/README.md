> The dev container command line interface (CLI) is a reference implementation
> for the Dev Container spec. It is in development in the devcontainers/cli
> repo. It is intended both for use directly and by tools or services that want
> to support the spec.
>
> The CLI can take a devcontainer.json and create and configure a dev container
> from it. It allows for prebuilding dev container definitions using a CI or
> DevOps product like GitHub Actions. It can detect and include dev container
> features and apply them at container runtime, and run lifecycle scripts like
> postCreateCommand, providing more power than a plain docker build and docker
> run.
